# bossbot: because why make decisions on your own?

Just a dumb bot I'm using as an outlet to code in my free time. It's currently being developed with python 3.8 on Ubuntu Focal Fossa 20.04

## To run

1. Create a `bossbot.ini` config file based on the format in `example.ini`
2. `make venv`
3. `venv/bin/python -m bossbot.bot`

Might need to install these packages: `sqlite python-dev python-venv`.
